This C++ program is an Employee Record Management System. It allows users (administrators) to perform various operations related to employee data management such as adding new employees, displaying all employees, searching for employees by ID, updating employee details, marking attendance, viewing attendance, viewing salary details, and deleting employee data.

The program is structured around two main classes: `Employee` and `EmployeeManagement`.

`Employee` Class
- Manages individual employee details such as name, ID, date of birth, date of joining, contact information, department, salary, etc.
- Provides methods to set, display, update, save to file, and read employee details from a file.
- Handles operations related to leaves and viewing leaves.

`EmployeeManagement` Class
- Provides methods to perform operations on employees in bulk, such as adding, displaying, searching, updating, deleting employees, marking attendance, viewing attendance, and viewing salary details.

The `main()` function acts as the driver for the program, offering a text-based interface for administrators to interact with and perform these various operations through a menu system.

The code extensively uses file I/O operations (`ifstream` and `ofstream`) to read and write employee data to text files.

The program uses a simple login system with hardcoded credentials (`admin` and `1234`), allowing access to the system's functionalities.
